This program ‘Password Reviewer’ allows you to enter your password in plaintext but returns or prints the password in asterisk form.

This program begins by requesting user input for both a username and password. 


It then calculates and masks the password, using asterisks to conceal the actual characters. 


The program's final output includes the username, the masked password, and additional security information. If the password contains more than 10 characters, it prints 'Your password is safe from password attacks.' Otherwise, it recommends that you update to a more complex password.
